# Third-Year-Paper
Online Appendix for Eleftherios Bethmage's GSEFM Third Year Paper.

## File Structure

### BOP-HH
- Contains a spreadsheet detailing which variables appear in each BOP-HH survey wave.

### Codebase
- Will contain all necessary replication codes. The code will be provided in an upcoming repository update.
- Required software: Stata 17.0+ and Python 3.9+
- Compatibility is only granted for UNIX-like systems.

### ECB
- Contains a spreadsheet with links to all European Central Bank (ECB) press releases during the reference period.

### Robustness-Analysis
- Contains robustness results for all 12 Governing Council meetings.

## Replication Instructions

In order to run the replication files, access to BOP-HH waves 1-36 is required. 
Access can be requested from the Bundesbank through the following link: [Bundesbank Research Data - BOP-HH](https://www.bundesbank.de/en/bundesbank/research/rdsc/research-data/bop-hh-757542).

In theory, it should also be possible to extend the research results with future waves without changing any line of code.
For further information, please refer to the information in the `Codebase` folder.
